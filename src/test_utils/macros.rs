/// Asserts that a stream of block ranges completely covers an expected block range.
///
/// This macro consumes messages from a stream and verifies that the block ranges received
/// sequentially cover the entire `expected_range` without gaps or overlaps. Each streamed
/// range must start exactly where the previous one ended, and all ranges must fit within
/// the expected bounds.
///
/// The macro expects the stream to yield `Message::Data(range)` variants containing
/// `RangeInclusive<u64>` values representing block ranges. It tracks coverage by ensuring
/// each new range starts at the next expected block number and doesn't exceed the end of
/// the expected range. Once the entire range is covered, the assertion succeeds.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use event_scanner::{assert_range_coverage, block_range_scanner::Message};
/// use tokio::sync::mpsc;
/// use tokio_stream::wrappers::ReceiverStream;
///
/// #[tokio::test]
/// async fn test_scanner_covers_range() {
///     let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel(10);
///     let mut stream = ReceiverStream::new(rx);
///
///     // Simulate a scanner that splits blocks 100-199 into chunks
///     tokio::spawn(async move {
///         tx.send(Message::Data(100..=149)).await.unwrap();
///         tx.send(Message::Data(150..=199)).await.unwrap();
///     });
///
///     // Assert that the stream covers blocks 100-199
///     assert_range_coverage!(stream, 100..=199);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
///
/// * **Timeout**: The stream doesn't produce the next expected range within the timeout period
///   (default 5 seconds, configurable via `timeout = N` parameter).
/// * **Gap or overlap**: A streamed range doesn't start exactly at the next expected block number,
///   indicating a gap or overlap in coverage.
/// * **Out of bounds**: A streamed range extends beyond the end of the expected range.
/// * **Wrong message type**: The stream yields a non-`Data` message (e.g., `Error` or `Status`)
///   when a block range is expected.
/// * **Stream closed early**: The stream ends before the entire expected range is covered.
///
/// On panic, the error message includes the expected remaining range and all previously
/// streamed ranges for debugging.
