    /// Due to the asynchronous nature of block scanning and log fetching, you may occasionally

    /// when:
    ///
    /// 1. `BlockRangeScanner` validates and emits a block range
    /// 2. A reorg occurs on the chain
    /// 3. `EventScanner` fetches logs for that range, but the RPC provider returns logs from the
    ///    post-reorg chain state (the provider's view has already updated)
    /// 4. `BlockRangeScanner` detects the reorg on its next check and emits
    ///    `Notification::ReorgDetected` with a new range starting from the first reorged block
    /// 5. `EventScanner` re-fetches logs for this range, which may return duplicate logs already
    ///    delivered in step 3 (the new range might also extend beyond the original range)
    ///
    /// **How to handle**: This is a benign race condition. Your application should be designed to
    /// handle duplicate logs idempotently (e.g., using transaction hashes or log indices as
    /// deduplication keys). Depending on your application semantics, you may also treat this
    /// notification as a signal to roll back application state derived from blocks after the
