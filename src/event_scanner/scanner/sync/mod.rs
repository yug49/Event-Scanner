    ///
    /// # How it works
    ///
    /// The scanner captures the latest block number before starting to establish a clear boundary
    /// between phases. The "latest events" phase scans from the current latest block to the genesis
    /// block, while the live phase starts from the block after the latest block. This design
    /// prevents duplicate events and handles race conditions where new blocks arrive during
    /// setup.
    ///
    /// # Key behaviors
    ///
    /// * **No duplicates**: Events are not delivered twice across the phase transition
    /// * **Flexible count**: If fewer than `count` events exist, returns all available events
    /// * **Reorg handling**: Both phases handle reorgs appropriately:
    ///   - Latest events phase: resets and rescans on reorg detection
    ///   - Live phase: resets stream to the first post-reorg block that satisfies the configured
    ///     block confirmations
    /// * **Continuous operation**: Live phase continues indefinitely until the scanner is dropped
    ///
    /// # Notifications
    ///
    /// During the **latest events phase**, the scanner can emit the following notification
    /// before transitioning to live mode:
    ///
    /// * **[`Notification::NoPastLogsFound`][no_logs]**: Emitted when no matching logs are found in
    ///   the scanned range
    ///
    /// After the latest events phase completes, [`Notification::SwitchingToLive`][switch_to_live]
    /// is emitted before transitioning to the live streaming phase.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `count` - Maximum number of recent events to collect per listener before switching to live
    ///   streaming (must be greater than 0)
    ///
    /// # Important notes
    ///
    /// * The live phase continues indefinitely until the scanner is dropped or encounters an error
    ///
    /// # Detailed reorg behavior
    ///
    /// * **Latest events phase**: Restart the scanner. On detecting a reorg, emits
    ///   [`Notification::ReorgDetected`][reorg], resets the rewind start to the new tip, and
    ///   continues until collectors accumulate `count` logs. Final delivery to listeners preserves
    ///   chronological order.
    /// * **Live streaming phase**: Starts from `latest_block + 1` and respects the configured block
    ///   confirmations. On reorg, emits [`Notification::ReorgDetected`][reorg], adjusts the next
    ///   confirmed window (possibly re-emitting confirmed portions), and continues streaming.
